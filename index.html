							<p>The goal of my work is to provide you with clarity, healing, and guidance on your journey through life. This will look different for every one of us, because we have each come into this life with unique strengths and weaknesses – there is no-one-size-fits-all model! The work I do allows you to connect more deeply with your own authenticity, your pure being, your vitality, and your highest self.  
                                <br/> <br/>

My energy healing services in the forms of energy balancing, clearing, and protection, are there to help you release the weight of old traumas, attachments, and outdated programming.  
 <br/> <br/>
I’m here to empower you to be who you are, support your connection to your spirituality, and to help you figure out your next steps or your north star goals, no matter where you are on your journey.

							<h2>About Jenna</h2>
									<p>Hi, I’m Jenna Bernstein. I’m an intuitive card reader, astrologer, pendulum dowser, energy worker, certified yoga instructor, and meditation guide. I have been interested in metaphysics, perception, and spirituality for as long as I can remember. I first felt called to study astrology, then tarot, and now pendulum dowsing, along with a variety of healing modalities including restorative yoga, Jin Shin Jyutsu, and Reiki. I work with the standard tarot, oracle cards, and angelic energy cards. My energy healing and intuitive readings are guided by spirit guides, angels, archangels, and beings of light.
